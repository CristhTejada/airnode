/// @title Contract that implements logic for withdrawals from sponsor wallets
/// @notice This contract is used by sponsors to request withdrawals from
/// sponsor wallets controlled by relayers and relayers to fulfill these
/// requests
/// @dev Withdrawals are implemented in the form of pull payments. The sponsor
/// requests a withdrawal from a sponsor wallet, and the relayer uses the
/// specified sponsor wallet to deposit the entire balance at this contract.
/// Then, the sponsor claims/pulls the payment from this contract.
/// We are referring to the relayer and not the Airnode because although an
/// Airnode operator may choose to relay their own fulfillments
/// (`airnode == relayer`), requesters can also request other parties to
/// relay fulfillments that are signed by a particular Airnode
/// (`airnode != relayer`). Since it is the relayer that is making the
/// fulfillment transaction, the relayer will be controlling the respective
/// sponsor wallet and will have to fulfill any withdrawal requests.
/// Sponsor wallet addresses are derived using the extended public key of the
/// relayer, the protocol ID and the sponsor address. The sponsor specifies
/// the sponsor wallet address and the protocol ID while requesting a
/// withdrawal, and the node must verify the consistency of this information
/// before fulfilling the request.
/// Different protocols (RRP, PSP, etc.) use different sponsor wallets for a
/// particular relayerâ€“sponsor pair, which is why sponsor wallet derivation
/// includes a protocol ID. Refer to the documentation of the particular node
/// implementation for what these protocol IDs are.
